If you just want to see the predicted data you need to 
   - Read the dataset
   - drop the null values
   - create the classes
   - run the sampler
   - define the CNN
   - do not train the model
   - Load the aug_cnn.pt file (file must be in root directory)
   - and run the predict function in the last
